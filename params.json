{"name":"CrowdyVis, Real Time Visualization of Crowd Dynamics","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to CrowDyVis a software tool for Real Time Visualization of Crowd Dynamics.\r\nWith CrowDyVis translates your crowd dynamics data to a 3D real time visualization giving you the opportunity to easily watch your crowd dynamics visualization. CrowDyVis is an application written with the free version of Unity, a game development tool, and is scripted in C#. On this website you will find information on how to use CrowDyVis, information about the project and a link to the github repository.\r\nFor a demonstration please take a look at [our youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbfzIl6_Jxs).\r\n\r\n### About us\r\nThe organization behind CrowDyVis consists of 4 students in collaboration with 2 supervisors from the University of Technology in Eindhoven (TU/e). This project has been executed in collaboration with the Institute of Complex Molecular Systems (ICMS) also located in Eindhoven. This project is started by the Honors Horizon Program from the TU/e and involved the creation of a self-made crowd dynamics simulation made in Matlab, an Unity application to visualize crowd dynamics (CrowDyVis) and a report describing the project.\r\n\r\n### How to use CrowDyVis\r\nIn order to use CrowDyVis you will need to provide two XML files. The first XML file contains the pedestrian data (the objects and their respective trajectories) and the second XML file contains the geometry (walls, obstacles and so on). For a more in depth explanation please take a look at the User Manual to be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ire82gy15xmlpdr/pcHJ9WjEl9).\r\n\r\n### Unity Files\r\nIn order to access the unity files such as packages can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ire82gy15xmlpdr/pcHJ9WjEl9). All the scripts together with the documentation can be found in the github folder.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nFor contact please send an email to the following address crowdyvis@gmail.com\r\n\r\n","google":"Crowd Dynamics Visualization TU/e University of Technology Eindhoven CrowDyVis","note":"Don't delete this file!
